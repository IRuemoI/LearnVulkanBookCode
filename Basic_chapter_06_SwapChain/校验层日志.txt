VUID-vkCmdPipelineBarrier-pImageMemoryBarriers-02820(ERROR / SPEC): msgNum: -1349691875 - Validation Error: [ VUID-vkCmdPipelineBarrier-pImageMemoryBarriers-02820 ] Object 0: handle = 0x2a73e4c7760, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER; | MessageID = 0xaf8d561d | vkCmdPipelineBarrier(): pImageMemoryBarriers[0].dstAccessMask (VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT) is not supported by stage mask (VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TOP_OF_PIPE_BIT). The Vulkan spec states: For any element of pImageMemoryBarriers, if its srcQueueFamilyIndex and dstQueueFamilyIndex members are equal, or if its dstQueueFamilyIndex is the queue family index that was used to create the command pool that commandBuffer was allocated from, then its dstAccessMask member must only contain access flags that are supported by one or more of the pipeline stages in dstStageMask, as specified in the table of supported access types (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.290.0/windows/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-vkCmdPipelineBarrier-pImageMemoryBarriers-02820)
