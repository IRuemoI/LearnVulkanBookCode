Shader in VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT uses push-constant statically but vkCmdPushConstants was not called yet for pipeline layout VkPipelineLayout 0x27d60e0000000019[]. The Vulkan spec states: If the maintenance4 feature is not enabled, then for each push constant that is statically used by a bound shader, a push constant value must have been set for the same pipeline bind point, with a VkPipelineLayout that is compatible for push constants, with the VkPipelineLayout used to create the current VkPipeline or the VkDescriptorSetLayout and VkPushConstantRange arrays used to create the current VkShaderEXT , as described in Pipeline Layout Compatibility (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.290.0/windows/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-vkCmdDraw-maintenance4-08602)
